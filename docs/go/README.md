# Introduction


The Counter API is a powerful REST API that allows developers to store and retrieve count data in a variety of applications. With the Counter API, you can easily keep track of user engagement, website traffic, and other important metrics without the need for a database or server. 

The API is available in both Go and CLI programming languages, making it available for a wide range of platforms. The Go library provides a convenient way to integrate the API into your Go projects, while the CLI provides a simple way to manage your count data from the command line. Whether you're a developer looking to build a custom dashboard or a business owner looking to track their website traffic, the Counter API is the perfect solution for you.
